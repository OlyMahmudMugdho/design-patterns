# Abstract Factory pattern
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when your system needs to support multiple product families and ensures that objects from the same family are used together.

## Key Concepts
1. **Abstract Factory:** An interface or abstract class defining methods to create abstract products.
2. **Concrete Factory:** Implements the abstract factory and produces concrete products of a specific family.
3. **Abstract Product:** Defines the interface for a type of product.
4. **Concrete Product:** Implements the abstract product and belongs to a specific family.
5. **Client:** Uses the factory and the products but is decoupled from their implementations.
